For the First file script.py this are the test cases I came up with in my own IDE

Basic Functionality Test:
Input: name = "World"
Expected Output: "Hello, World!"
Purpose: To test if the function returns the correct greeting for a common input.
Empty String Test:
Input: name = ""
Expected Output: "Hello, !"
Purpose: To check how the function handles an empty string as input.
